Navigating the Waves: Why Your Grief Journey Won't Be a Straight Line
If you have recently lost a loved one, you might have expected a timeline. Maybe you thought that after the funeral, you would feel bad for a while, then slightly better, and eventually, "normal" again. Like climbing a ladder, one step at a time.
But if you are reading this, you probably know that grief doesn’t work that way.
One day, you might feel strong enough to laugh at a joke. The next morning, you might struggle to get out of bed because a song on the radio reminded you of them.
If you feel like you are taking one step forward and two steps back, take a deep breath. You aren’t doing it wrong. You are just experiencing the true, nonlinear nature of the grief journey.
The Myth of the "5 Stages"
We have all heard of the "Five Stages of Grief": Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance.
It is a helpful framework, but it creates a misleading map. Many people believe these stages are a checklist; that once you finish "Anger," you move to "Bargaining" and never look back.
In reality, grief is messy. You might feel Acceptance on Tuesday and Anger on Wednesday. You might skip a stage entirely, or experience three of them in a single hour. Grief is not a straight highway; it is an ocean.

Understanding the "Grief Comes in Waves" Metaphor
A viral analogy describes grief as being shipwrecked. At first, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. You can barely catch your breath between them.
As time passes, the waves don’t disappear, but they become smaller and further apart. You might have weeks of calm water. But then; often without warning, a "grief wave" hits you out of nowhere.
It could be triggered by:
A specific date (birthdays, anniversaries).
A smell (their favorite food cooking).
A mundane moment (reaching for the phone to call them).
When these waves hit, it can feel like you are back at square one. You are not. You have learned how to swim; the water just got rough for a moment.

Why "Moving Backward" is Actually Healing
When you have a bad day after a string of good ones, it’s easy to judge yourself. You might think, "I should be over this by now."
But that "regression" is often a sign that your mind is processing a new layer of the loss. Grief is like peeling an onion; there are many layers to work through. A sudden wave of sadness doesn't mean you are failing; it means you are feeling. And feeling is the only way to heal.
3 Ways to Stay Afloat When the Wave Hits
1. Stop Fighting the Water
If you try to swim against a riptide, you will drown. If you float with it, it will eventually release you. When a wave of grief hits, don't punish yourself for feeling sad. Acknowledge it: "I am really missing them today, and that is okay."
2. Look for the "Glimmers"
In the middle of the storm, look for tiny moments of safety. Psychologists call these "glimmers." It could be a warm cup of tea, a text from a friend, or a beautiful sunset. These small anchors remind your nervous system that you are safe, even if you are sad.
3. Create a Permanent Anchor
One of the hardest parts of grief is the fear that you will forget them, or that the world will move on without them. Grounding yourself by preserving their memory can help.
Creating a digital obituary or memorial profile on RIP.KE gives you a dedicated space to visit when the waves get high. It’s a place where their story, photos, and tributes live safely forever, giving you a physical (or digital) destination for your love.

Conclusion: You Are Still Moving Forward
Navigating the waves of grief is exhausted work. But remember: a spiral is not a straight line, but it still moves upward.
Even on the days when you feel like you are sinking, you are surviving. You are carrying their memory forward. And slowly, the waves will become manageable, and you will find that you can breathe again.
Do you need a safe space to anchor your memories? Create a respectful, permanent digital tribute for your loved one in just 5 minutes at RIP.KE. Let their legacy live on.
