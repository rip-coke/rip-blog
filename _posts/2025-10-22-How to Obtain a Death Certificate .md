A death certificate is essential for funerals, bank claims, insurance, pension and legal processes. This guide explains the Kenyan process, required documents, typical timelines and practical tips.

## Who issues death certificates
- In Kenya, a death is certified by a medical practitioner (for natural deaths) or by a medical officer/forensic pathologist (for unnatural deaths). The hospital, police, or county registrar issues the official certificate or notification needed for burial and legal claims.

## Immediate steps at the place of death
1. **If death occurs in hospital:** The hospital issues a medical certificate of cause of death and provides guidance on obtaining the official death certificate from the county registrar.  
2. **If death occurs at home:** Notify the nearest police station and your local health facility. A clinician will examine the body; for natural deaths the clinician may issue a medical form to take to the registrar. For suspicious or sudden deaths, police and a post‑mortem may be required.

## Documents required
- Completed medical certificate of cause of death (from hospital/clinician) or police report (if applicable).  
- Original national ID or passport of the deceased (copies may be accepted initially).  
- Next of kin’s ID and filled application forms required by the county registrar or hospital mortuary.  
- For deaths outside Kenya, the Kenyan embassy or consulate will coordinate documentation for repatriation.

## Where to apply
- **County Registrar of Births and Deaths:** Most counties require registration at the local county office where the death occurred. Bring the medical certificate and IDs.  
- **Hospitals and mortuaries:** Many hospitals assist families with registration or forward the necessary forms to the registrar.  
- **Police stations:** For deaths involving the police or where a post‑mortem is required, obtain the police report and follow directions to the registrar.

## Typical timelines and fees
- Registration timelines vary by county; many issue a death notification or certificate within 24–72 hours for natural deaths once paperwork is complete. Post‑mortem or police investigations can extend this.  
- Fees are minimal or waived in many counties for death registration; confirm with the local county registrar.

## Using the death certificate
- You will need certified copies for banks, insurers, KRA, NHIF, pension providers, and for applying for burial permits. Make several certified copies at the county office or a magistrate’s office.

## Common issues and solutions
- **Missing medical certificate:** Return to the issuing hospital/clinician to obtain the completed form.  
- **Delayed post‑mortem:** Keep in touch with the police and mortuary; obtain a police report or clearance letter for administrative steps.  
- **Disputes over identity:** Bring witnesses, original IDs, or community leaders to confirm identity.

## Practical checklist
1. Obtain medical certificate of cause of death from hospital/clinician or police report.  
2. Visit the county registrar with the deceased’s ID and the next of kin’s ID.  
3. Request multiple certified copies.  
4. Use certified copies for banks, insurers, KRA, NHIF, pensions and burial permits.

## Where to get help
- Hospital administration, county registrar offices, local police station, funeral directors, and legal aid clinics.

A timely, correctly issued death certificate speeds access to benefits, enables lawful burial and protects families from administrative delays and fraud.
