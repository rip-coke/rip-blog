title: When Your Valentine Isn't Here: Navigating the Hardest Day of the Year
---

If you walked into a supermarket today, you were probably assaulted by a sea of red and pink. Heart-shaped chocolates, oversized teddy bears. Everywhere you turn, there are reminders of romance, and social media is flooded with declarations of "forever."

For most of the world, Valentine's Day is a day of romance and grand gestures. But for those of us navigating the loss of a partner, a spouse, or a great love, today doesn't feel like a celebration. It feels like a spotlight shining directly on an empty chair. It’s a deafening reminder of the silence in the house, the text message that won't arrive, and the hand you can no longer hold.

But we all know that grief is simply love with nowhere to go. So, how do we navigate a day dedicated to love when our person is gone? 

#### The Anticipation is Often Worse Than the Day

First, take a deep breath. The build-up to significant dates, anniversaries, birthdays, and yes, Valentine's Day, is often more agonizing than the day itself. The dread of "how will I get through this?" takes a heavy toll.

Permit yourself to lower the bar today. If survival looks like staying in bed with Netflix and ignoring the world, that is okay. You do not owe anyone "strength" today.

#### Redefining What Connection Means

Societal grief tells us we should eventually move on. But true love doesn't work like that. You don't move on from a person who shaped your life; you move forward with them.

Death ends a life, but it does not end a relationship. 

On Valentine's Day, the relationship just looks different. It’s no longer about dinner reservations. It’s about memory. It’s about legacy. It’s about honoring the imprint they left on your soul.

#### Three Gentle Ways to Honor Your Love Today

If you feel up to doing something active today, here are three ways to channel that love into remembrance.

  1. **Write the letter.** So many of us carry things left unsaid. Or perhaps, you just want to tell them about your day, about how much you miss them. Sit down with a pen and paper. Write a Valentine’s card to them. Pour it all out. You don't have to show it to anyone. It’s just between you and them.

  2. **Do their "thing."** Did they love a specific coffee shop? Were they obsessed with a certain type of movie? Did they love taking walks in a specific park? Today, do the thing they loved doing. It might bring tears, but it might also bring you closer to the feeling of their presence.

  3. **Secure their memory.** Sometimes, the fear of forgetting is almost as strong as the pain of the loss. We are terrified that their stories, their laugh, or the details of your love story will fade over time. 

That is why we are proud to launch our partnership with [The Unapologetic Mic](https://theunapologeticmic.com/ ). We joined forces because, despite our different roles, we share the same philosophy on loss.

If today hurts, you are allowed to hurt. You don't have to "look on the bright side." You don't have to pretend that a digital tribute or a podcast episode fixes the pain.

What we *can offer*, however, is a space where that pain is respected. *The Unapologetic Mic* offers the space to speak about it. [RIP.ke](https://rip.ke) offers the space to **preserve it**.

We stand together to honor those who have lost partners. If today is unbearably heavy, please remember that you are not walking this path alone. There is a whole community of us who understand that the deepest grief is born from the deepest love. And remember that your reality, however messy or painful, is valid.

Sending extra gentleness your way today!
