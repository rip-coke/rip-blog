- Full Name of the Deceased (and any nicknames they were widely known by).
- Their Role: (e.g., Beloved husband of..., devoted mother to..., son of...).
- Age or Year of Birth/Death (optional but common).
- Cause of death (Briefly, e.g., "after a short illness". It is also acceptable to omit this).
- Family details: Listing parents, spouse, children, and siblings is culturally very important.
- Funeral & Burial Arrangements: Dates, times, and venues for the service and burial.
- Cortège Details: When the body leaves the mortuary.
