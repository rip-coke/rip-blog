### How to Get a Burial Permit in Kenya

In the rush of funeral planning, one document is non-negotiable: the **Burial Permit**.
Whether you are planning a burial in a public cemetery like Lang'ata or on private family land upcountry, the law in Kenya requires you to have a valid burial permit before the interment can take place.

It is also the primary document police will ask for if they stop a hearse during transport. Without it, the funeral cannot proceed. This guide explains exactly how to obtain one quickly and correctly to avoid last-minute delays.

#### What is a Burial Permit?

A burial permit (or burial order) is an official document from the county or cemetery manager authorizing interment in a specific grave or cemetery. It ensures legal compliance and proper recordkeeping.

It serves two main purposes:

- **Legal Authorization:** It proves the death has been registered and the government is aware of the burial.

- **Record Keeping:** It ensures there is an official record of where the deceased rests.

#### When Do You Need It?

You need a burial permit for **every** burial, regardless of location.

- **Public Cemeteries:** The caretaker will not allow the grave to be dug without seeing this permit.

- **Private Land:** Even if burying on your own farm, you legally require this permit to transport the body and conduct the burial lawfully.

#### Documents You Will Need

Before going to the office, ensure you have the following originals and copies:

1. [The Death Notification (Form D1 link it to the death permit blog post):](/How-to-Obtain-a-Death-Certificate-In-Kenya/) This is the form issued by the hospital or the police (if the death happened at home). 
2. **Deceased’s National ID:** You may be required to surrender the original ID card (or a copy, depending on the county).
3. **Applicant’s ID:** The Next of Kin applying for the permit must present their own ID.
4. **Cemetery Booking (If applicable):** Some city councils require proof of payment for the grave before issuing the final order.

#### Where to Apply

The application point depends on your location, but it is generally one of these three:

1. **Civil Registration Office:** The local District Registrar of Births and Deaths (often found at the County Commissioner's office or Huduma Centre).
2. **County Government Offices:** In major cities like Nairobi or Mombasa, specific counters at City Hall or county offices handle burial permits.
3. **The Hospital/Mortuary:** Some major hospitals have a resident Registrar or Public Health Officer who can issue the permit on-site to save you the trip. Ask the mortuary superintendent if this service is available.

#### Fees and Timelines
**Cost:** The fee is usually nominal (often between **KES 50 – 500**) depending on the county and whether it is a public or private burial.

**Timeline:** It is typically issued **immediately** (same day) provided your documents are in order.

*Note:* If a post-mortem is pending or there is a police case, the permit will be withheld until the authorities give clearance.

#### Important: The "Transport" Aspect

- If you are transporting the body across county lines (e.g., from Nairobi to Kisumu), this permit acts as your "Gate Pass." Ensure the driver of the hearse has the **original** permit in the vehicle. Police roadblocks frequently check for this specific document to prevent illegal movement of bodies.

#### Summary Checklist

- Obtain Death Notification (Form D1) from hospital/police.

- Make copies of the Deceased’s ID and your ID.

- Visit the Civil Registrar or County Office.

- Pay the prescribed fee.

- Receive the Burial Permit.

- **Hand the original to the Hearse Driver** on the funeral day.

#### Closing 

Securing the Burial Permit is a quick but vital step. Getting it sorted early in the week ensures that on the funeral day, your only focus can be on honoring the life of your loved one, not handling paperwork.
