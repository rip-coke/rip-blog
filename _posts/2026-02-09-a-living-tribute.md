When we lose someone we love, our first instinct is to buy flowers. They are beautiful, but they fade within a week. But what if you could give a tribute that lasts? One that grows stronger every year, just like your memories?

Planting a tree is one of the most healing things you can do during grief. It is an act of hope. It says, *"Even though this life has ended, life itself goes on."*

Whether you have a large shamba upcountry or just a small corner in a church compound, here is how to create a living memorial for your loved one.

#### 1. Choosing the Right Tree (Kenyan Context)

Don't just plant any tree; plant one that tells a story.

  - **Fruit Trees (Mango, Avocado, Citrus):** Perfect for rural homes. They provide "fruit for the grandchildren", a symbol of how your loved one continues to feed and nurture the family even after they are gone.

  - **Indigenous Trees (Acacia, Mahogany, Meru Oak):** These are resilient and drought-resistant. They represent strength and endurance.

  - **Shade Trees (Nandi Flame, Jacaranda):** Beautiful and colorful, offering a resting place for future generations to sit and tell stories.

#### 2. The Planting Ritual: Involve the Family

Make the planting day a special event, separate from the funeral.

  - **Involve the Children:** Grief can be abstract for kids. Letting them get their hands dirty; digging the hole, pouring the water, gives them a physical way to say goodbye.

  - **Say a Prayer:** Gather the family in a circle. Share a memory as you place the sapling in the earth.

  - **Mark the Spot:** You don't need an expensive tombstone. A simple painted stone or a small wooden plaque with their name and dates is enough.

#### 3. Practical Care (The First 12 Months)

A tree needs love to survive, just like us.

  - **Watering Rota:** Assign a family member or a neighbour to water it during the dry seasons.

  - **Protection:** Goats and cows love fresh saplings! Put up a small wire mesh or a "boma" of thorns around it until it is strong enough to stand on its own.

#### 4. Can't Plant One Yourself? Let Us Help.

We know that not everyone has ancestral land or the ability to travel upcountry to maintain a sapling. But we believe everyone should have the option to leave a living legacy.

That is why at [rip.ke](https://rip.ke), we offer a [Memorial Tree Service](https://rip.ke/trees/). You can choose to have a tree planted in your loved one's honor directly through our platform. Whether it is part of a comprehensive tribute or added as a special request, we handle the digging, the planting, and the care.
It is a hassle-free way to ensure that while you preserve their story online, their physical legacy is contributing to the lungs of our country.
