Planting a tree as a living memorial is meaningful, affordable, and environmentally positive. This short guide outlines practical steps for families to create a lasting tribute.

## Choosing the right tree and location
- **Purpose:** Shade, fast growth, fruit, or native species for biodiversity.  
- **Recommended species:** African mahogany, Grevillea, Faidherbia albida (fertiliser tree), mango or citrus (for fruit), and indigenous indigenous acacia varieties—choose based on local climate and space.  
- **Location:** Home compound, school grounds, church land (with permission), or community tree‑planting sites managed by county governments or NGOs.

## Permissions and partners
- **Landowner consent:** Get written permission if planting on communal or institutional land.  
- **Partners:** Work with local tree nurseries, county forestry offices, schools, or NGOs (e.g., Green Belt Movement affiliates) for seedlings and technical advice.

## Planting and maintenance steps
1. **Source healthy seedlings** from reliable nurseries—buy or request donations from community groups.  
2. **Dig a suitable hole** (twice the width of the root ball), loosen soil, and add compost if available.  
3. **Plant at correct depth,** water thoroughly and stake young trees if necessary.  
4. **Mulch and water** regularly during the first 6–12 months—establish a watering schedule with family or community volunteers.  
5. **Protect from animals** with fencing or tree guards until established.

## Involve the community and children
- Make planting a memorial event: say a few words, share memories, and involve children with simple rituals (pouring water, placing stones). This supports grief processing and creates stewardship.

## Legal and record considerations
- **Mark and record** the tree’s location (GPS or photo) and the planting date. Keep a small plaque or marker if desired.  
- **Community agreements:** If the tree is on communal land, agree on maintenance responsibilities to avoid future disputes.

## Funding and sustainability
- **Low cost:** Seedlings and basic materials are inexpensive; chamas or church groups can pool funds.  
- **Grants and NGO support:** Some environmental groups provide free seedlings or technical training for memorial plantings.

## Practical checklist
1. Choose species and site with landowner permission.  
2. Source seedlings and planting materials.  
3. Plant with family/community, include a small ceremony.  
4. Set a watering and maintenance rota for 6–12 months.  
5. Record location and date; consider a marker or plaque.

A memorial tree offers an ongoing, living reminder that benefits the environment and community while helping families honour and remember their loved ones.
