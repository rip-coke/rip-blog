excerpt: Shocked by newspapers obituary rates? See the cost comparison between traditional newspaper ads and permanent digital obituaries on rip.ke. Save money without compromising on legacy.
---

For decades, placing an obituary in one of Kenya’s leading newspapers has been the standard way to announce a passing. It is a tradition many of us grew up with. But as funeral costs rise across the country, families are starting to ask a difficult question: Is a one-day newspaper announcement really the best use of our limited budget?

When you compare the costs and the longevity, the difference between the traditional print route and the modern digital approach is staggering.

Here is a breakdown of the real costs of newspaper vs. digital obituaries to help you make the right choice for your family.

1. **The Financial Cost: KES 15,000 vs. KES 5,000**

The most immediate difference is the price tag. Newspaper pricing is based on space, every centimeter counts.

  - **The Newspaper Reality:** A standard, modest obituary (often black and white, with a small photo) in a major Kenyan daily newspaper can start anywhere from **KES 12,000 to KES 20,000**. If you want color, or a larger size to include a poem or a full list of relatives, the price can easily jump to **KES 40,000 or more**.
    
  - **The Digital Alternative:** At **rip.ke**, we offer a flat-rate model. For a one-time fee (starting at just **KES 5,000**), you get a premium memorial profile. No word counts, no "per centimeter" charges.

You could save over **70%** of your announcement budget by switching to digital money that can be better used for the funeral service or hospital bills.

2. **The Lifespan: 24 Hours vs. Forever**

  - Newspapers expire in 24 hours. It is a harsh reality, but yesterday’s newspaper is often used to wrap meat or vegetables today. You pay thousands of shillings for a tribute that is viewed for one morning and then discarded.

  - Digital is Permanent. A digital obituary on rip.ke does not have an expiration date. It stays online forever. It becomes a permanent archive where grandchildren can one day visit to see their ancestor's face, read their life story, and see the tributes left by friends.

3. **The Content Limit: "Cutting Words" vs. "Telling the Whole Story"**

Have you ever tried to write an obituary for a newspaper? It often involves painful editing.

  - **The Print Struggle:** You find yourself deleting sentences to save money. You might have to leave out the names of grandchildren or cut the "Eulogy" down to just two sentences because the ad space is too expensive.

  - **The Digital Freedom:** On a digital platform, space is unlimited. You can upload:

    - <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> The full 1,000-word life history (Eulogy).

    - <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> A gallery of 50+ photos from their childhood to their final days.

    - <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> The full Funeral Program (PDF).

    - <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> A Family Tree.

### Comparison Table

FEATURE|TRADITIONAL NEWSPAPER AD|RIP.KE DIGITAL MEMORIAL
-|-|-
Cost|High (KES 15k - 50k+)|Low (Flat Fee ~KES 5k)
Lifespan|1 Day (24 Hours)|Permanent (Forever)
Space|Limited (Pay per word/cm)|Unlimited (Photos & Text)
Reach|Local (Only where sold)|Global (Shareable Link)
Edits|Impossible once printed|Edit anytime


We understand that for some families, the tradition of the newspaper is important, especially for reaching older relatives who don't use smartphones.

### Our recommendation? Use both.

  1. **Go Small in Print:** Pay for the smallest, cheapest newspaper strip available (just the name, photo, and date).

  2. **Go Big Digital:** In that small newspaper ad, include the line: *"Read the full life story and view photos at **rip.ke/[Name]**"*

This saves you money on the print ad while still giving your loved one the detailed, permanent tribute they deserve.

### Conclusion

Legacy shouldn't be expensive, and it certainly shouldn't be temporary. While newspapers serve a purpose for immediate notification, they cannot offer a place for a legacy to live on.
